# Drops
My Take on Automation of the Drops WebApp
A high level test of the main functionalities users interact with in the Web App.
I Focused on the main features the user is going to interact with :
The script focuses on the Logging in as a user and navigating to the landing page
The second commit focuses on course selection by a user up to the start of the course.
It was a good challenge going through the site, capturing the test elements to be called up, 
The Web App is well-coded and suited for Cypress which I found helpful and eased the process for me
